# Programming Assignment 1
Client and Server code are hosted in the client and server files, respectively. To compile either navigate to its directory and type `make`. The executable will be name either `client` or `server` depending on which you've chosen to do at that time.

Usage can be found by running either executable but it is also as follows.
- `./server <port number>`
- `.client <host> <port number>`

The only thing implemented is udp. No reliable file delivery has been attempted here.
